Code from Intro to Python and Intro to Deep Learning workshops given at LingHacks 2018.

## Intro to Python
This is a basic intro to the Python programming language that covers basic variables, lists, dictionaries, functions, conditional statements, loops, and list comprehension. introtopython.py contains all the code; to step through it interactively, run introtopython.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

## Intro to Deep Learning
This is a tutorial on covering the implementation of a basic LSTM network using the IMDB dataset from Keras. Run ```sh python lstmintro.py```.
